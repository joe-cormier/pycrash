Description: Pycrash
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        Pycrash is a 2D mathematical model for simulating vehicle motion and vehicular impacts using a variety of approaches based on fundamental physics and published accident reconstruction techniques.
        
        
        #### Planar Vehicle Motion
        1. Single vehicle motion based on driver inputs (brake, throttle, steer)
        2. Multi-vehicle motion with impact detection
          - currently two vehicles, impact response based on two different approaches.
        
        #### Impact Simulation
        1. Single Degree of Freedom Model
          - basic 2D collision with user defined stiffness values and braking effects
          - no pre and post vehicle motion model use for impact severity calculations
          - vehicle specific data is published for most vehicles by the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/database/veh/veh.htm)
          - use published stiffness data such as [Bonugli et al.](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2017-01-1417/) or [Lee et al.](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2014-01-0351/) as examples
        
        2. Sideswipe (in progress)
            - similar to previous model developed and validated by [Funk et al.](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2004-01-1185/)
            - improved to allow for driver inputs and flexible approach angles and contact locations
        3. Impulse Momentum Planar Collision (in progress)
          - model based on conservation of momentum incorporating inter-vehicular sliding developed by [Carpenter et al.](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2019-01-0422/)
        
        
        #### Validation
          - Single vehicle motion
            - physical testing
            - comparison with PC Crash
          - Sideswipe
          - Momentum
          - validation data available in this repo
        
        #### Modular Design
        
          - Model calculations divided into modules to allow for future improvements
          - Vehicle motion incorporates a modular linear tire model to determine slip condition based on weight shift from longitudinal and lateral acceleration. 
        
        
        ### Recommendations
        - Download Python [here](https://www.python.org/) and install required packages with pip from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) 
        - Pycrash is built around [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) so you can manipulate the output of Pycrash functions directly with Pandas
        - See [Github](https://github.com/joe-cormier/pycrash) repo for tutorials, Jupyter Notebooks and validation data
