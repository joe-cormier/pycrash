Description: Pycrash
        =
        
        Pycrash is a 2D mathematical model for simulating vehicle motion and vehicular impacts using a variety of
        approaches based on fundamental physics and published accident reconstruction techniques.  In addition to fundamental
        applications, Pycrash has accident reconstruction specific modules for obtaining and processing commonly used data
        
        ##### Installation (Requires Python > 3.6)
        pip install pycrash
        [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pycrash/)
        
        #### Planar Vehicle Motion
        1. Single vehicle motion based on driver inputs (brake, throttle, steer)
        2. Multi-vehicle motion and multiple impacts per vehicle
        
        #### Impact Simulation
        ##### Single Degree of Freedom Model
          - basic 2D collision with user defined stiffness values and braking effects
          - vehicle specific data is published for most vehicles by the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/database/veh/veh.htm)
          - use published stiffness data such as [Bonugli et al.](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2017-01-1417/) or [Lee et al.](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2014-01-0351/) as examples
        ##### Impulse Momentum Planar Collision
         - model based on conservation of momentum incorporating inter-vehicular sliding developed by [Carpenter et al.](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2019-01-0422/)
        ##### Sideswipe (*in progress*)
           - similar to previous model developed and validated by [Funk et al.](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2004-01-1185/)
           - improved to allow for driver inputs and flexible approach angles and contact locations
        
        #### Validation
          - validation data are provided within the [Github](https://github.com/joe-cormier/pycrash) repo
        
        #### Modular Design
          - Model calculations divided into modules to allow for future improvements
          - Vehicle motion incorporates a modular linear tire model to determine slip condition based on weight shift from longitudinal and lateral acceleration.
        
        ### Collaboration
          - Contributors are welcome - create a branch to develop a new capability or improve the current model
          - There is a list of projects in the report for future applications that I would like to pursue
          - Create an issue if you identify a problem or to make suggestions for future improvements
          - Additional validation data are always welcome
        
        #### Recommendations
        - Download Python [here](https://www.python.org/) and install required packages with pip from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)
        - See [Github](https://github.com/joe-cormier/pycrash) repo for tutorials, Jupyter Notebooks and validation data
        - The validation and demonstration of Pycrash is best viewed using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
