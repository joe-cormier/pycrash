Pycrash
------------------------------------------------

A comprehensive analytical tool for accident reconstruction

## Capabilities

#### Vehicle Motion
1. Single vehicle motion based on driver inputs
2. Multi-vehicle motion with impact detection

Vehicle motion incorporates a modular tire model to determine slip condition based on weight shift from longitudinal and lateral acceleration.  Based on PC-Crash model.  

#### Impact Simulation
1. Single Degree of Freedom Model
2. Sideswipe
3. Impulse Momentum Planar Collision

## Applications




### Recommendations
- If you are new to python, I recommend looking into [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) it is an easy way to get python working on your machine.    
- Pycrash is built around [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) so you can manipulate the output of Pycrash functions directly with Pandas.
