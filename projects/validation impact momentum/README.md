Impact Momentum Validation
=========================

-  The data and notebooks contained here were used to validate the Pycrash Carpenter model against published data
-  The SAE Paper by [Gray Beauchamp et al.](https://saemobilus.sae.org/content/2019-01-0418/)
-  These simulations did not contain pre-impact motion - the condition at impact was defined based on the test data
-  Runout for the simulations was performed using the Pycrash vehicle motion model
