Single Vehicle Motion Validation
=========================

-  The data and notebooks contained here were used to assess Pycrash's performance against PC-Crash simulations
-  Single steer maneuvers were performed at varying speeds
-  Fishhook tests were also performed which consisted of two consecutive steer inputs
-  The underlying data is provided within the data directory and the notebooks can be used to produce the Pycrash outputs for comparison
-  Custom modules are provded to compare the output between the two models - these modules can be applied to future datasets
